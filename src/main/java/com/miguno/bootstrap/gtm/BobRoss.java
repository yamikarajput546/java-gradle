/**
 * A simple class that implements a few features that we can write unit tests for. It uses Google Guava for the sole
 * reason that we have an external compile-time dependency in this bootstrap project.
 * 
 * To make the example code simpler this class does not follow pure OO style. (If it did, we would create a Painting
 * object from painting elements and let our painter paint that painting object, for instance.)
 * 
 * "And from all of us here I'd like to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friend."
